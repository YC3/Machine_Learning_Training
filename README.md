# Machine Learning Algorithms

The scripts in this repository are some machine learning algorithms coded in python after I had used maching learning for a while. 

## About the repository

## Purpose

The purpose is to "open the machine learning blackbox" and to help myself have a better knowledge of the commonly used machine learning algorithms. 


All uploaded scripts have been tested on data in the folder 'Toydata'.
